        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with experience in Java, Spring Boot,
            and modern frontend technologies like React and Next.js. I enjoy building
            scalable web applications, learning new technologies, and solving complex
            problems with efficient solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started my journey in software development a few years ago and focused on
            creating full-stack web solutions. I have hands-on experience in backend
            development, RESTful APIs, and database management using MySQL and PostgreSQL.
            I continuously work on improving my skills and building meaningful projects.

                Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.
